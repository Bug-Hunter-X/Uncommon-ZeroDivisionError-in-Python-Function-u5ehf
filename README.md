This repository contains a demonstration of an uncommon error in Python related to the ZeroDivisionError. The main file, bug.py, contains a function that potentially throws a ZeroDivisionError if the input is 0. The solution, shown in bugSolution.py, addresses the issue with more robust exception handling. The error is subtle because it's not always triggered, and it depends on how the function is called and the type of input.
